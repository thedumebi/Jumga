# Jumga
Flutterwave Dev Challenge
This Jumga app is done using MERN stack (MongoDb, Express, React and Node).
Three sets of people can perform operations (Vendors, Clients (read customers) and Dispatch). 
When a shop is registered, the assignDispatch function is called and an available dispatch rider is assigned to the shop. 
I made use of the flutterwave v3 /payment endpoint instead of the /card endpoint because I do not want to collect card details in any instance.
Similarly, when a user wants to buy an item, the payment end point is also called and then once transaction is verified, value is given to the customer.













Disclaimer: I am fairly new at programming and especially new with fullstack development (two months) so there might be better ways to do somethings I did 
and as time passes I’d update some things. Cheers.
